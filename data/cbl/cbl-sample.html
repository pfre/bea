<h1>CBL Lookup Utility</h1>
<p>Automated/scripted bulk lookups are forbidden.
Upon detection, automated scripts will be denied access, and the
source IP may be listed in the CBL.

<p>IP Address 1.2.3.4 <strong>is listed</strong> in the CBL. It appears to be infected with  a spam sending trojan or proxy.</p>
<p>It was last detected at 2012-02-24 00:00 GMT (+/- 30 minutes), approximately 9 hours, 30 minutes ago.</p>
<font size="+1">
<p>This IP is sending email in such a way to indicate that
it is, or is NATting for a web server that is infected with a
spam sending script, like Darkmailer, DirectMailer, r57shell,
or some analogous Perl, PHP or CGI script.
</p>
</font>
<p>
If, however, you are running the "sendmagic" mail server package,
please contact your vendor for an update.
</p>
<p>
If you are not running "sendmagic", the following should help you
identify where the spam sending script is located so that you
can remove it as well as innoculate your web server so it doesn't
happen again.
</p>
<p>
This IP is infected with, or is NATting for a machine that is infected with,
a PHP-based backdoor trojan.
The most common target of this infestation is Plesk hosting environments
using Qmail and Wordpress or CPanel hosting environments.
</p>
<p>
</p><h2>The WebMaster should pay very close attention to the following:</h2>
<p>
This infects web hosting environments.
ONLY the hosting company can fix these infections properly.
</p>
<p>
If you are not the
administrator of this hosting environment, there is probably nothing
you can do to fix this infection, you MUST refer this listing
to them.  The hosting administrator has to do the fix.
We recommend you forward this email to them.
</p>
<p>
This is a checklist of things the administrator needs to
do before delisting.
</p>
<al>
<li>
Turn off PHP script support within the web server
except where absolutely necessary.
</li>
<li>
Many of these compromises appear to be uploaded via a vulnerability
in older versions of WordPress.
Make sure you have the latest version.
</li>
<li>
Identify, kill and remove the backdoor trojan scripts currently on the
web server (see below).
</li>
<li>
Implement port 25 blocking so that only your mail server software
userid can make outbound port 25 connections from this machine.
</li>
</al>
<p>
</p><h2>How to find web-based PHP (and other) backdoor trojan scripts.</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://25yearsofprogramming.com/blog/20070705.htm">How to prevent your site from getting hacked. How to repair a damaged site. Website security precautions.</a>
and its companion document
<a href="http://25yearsofprogramming.com/blog/2010/20100315.htm">Website security: How to find backdoor PHP shell scripts on a server</a>
have detailed instructions on how to find various kinds of web server
trojans and back doors.
</p><p>
There is a simple script at the end of this web page that you
can download and run.  This script is known
to detect at least some of these backdoors.
</p>
<p>
In one case, two malicious files were involved.
One was a malicious .htaccess file that could be found by:
(substitute rootdir with the directory of your
web hosting directories):
</p>
<pre class="notranslate">  find rootdir -name '.htaccess' -print | xargs grep 'RewriteRule' 
</pre>
<p>
This yielded a line like this naming the malicious PHP script:
</p>
<pre class="notranslate">  RewriteRule . /phpinfo.php [L]
</pre>
<p>
Alternately, the script itself could be found with the following
command:
</p><pre class="notranslate">  find rootdir -name '*.php' -print | xargs grep 'eval(base64_decode'
</pre>
<p>
Which yields a line like this:
</p>
<pre class="notranslate">  eval(base64_decode('DQpAZXJ ... 
</pre>
<p>
Followed by many lines of Base64 encoding.


</p><h2>Securing your server from future infections</h2>
<p>
There are a variety of things to do.
</p>
<al>
<li>
Ensure that your web server does not allow clients to modify
".htaccess" files.
</li>
<li>
Only permit PHP where necessary.
</li>
<li>
You <strong>SHOULD</strong> configure your web server to prevent
such infections being able to spam the Internet.
Once you've done this correctly, it doesn't matter whether the
spammer can still upload this malware, they can't spam with it, so
they'll leave you alone.
<p></p>
<p>
There are a variety of ways to do this.  In short, you're implementing
a firewall restriction that only permits root and the mail server
userid to make outbound port 25 (email) connections.
You can either do it yourself with a software firewall, or, use
third party software to do the same thing.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://configserver.com/">configserver.com</a> has a variety
of products and services that can deal with this issue.
Note that the CBL has no connection whatsoever with ConfigServer.
If you know of other software packages that can deal with Darkmailer
please let us know and we'll mention them here.
</p>
<p>
The most commonly used ConfigServer product appears to be
<a href="http://configserver.com/cp/csf.html">
ConfigServer Security and Firewall (CSF)</a> and it's FREE.
The feature you want to turn on is "CSF SMTP_BLOCK" which, as far
as we can tell, does exactly the firewall restrictions we describe
above.
</p>
<p>
Another product that ConfigServer offers is
<a href="http://configserver.com/cp/cxs.html">
ConfigServer eXploit Scanner (CXS)</a>.
This software is not free ($75 regular price, currently $50).
This software monitors FTP uploads in real-time, will automatically
detect Darkmailer and other malicious downloads, and remove them.
</p>
<p>
Most Cpanel implementations already have something called "SMTP Tweak"
(aka "WHM SMTP Tweak")
available.
It apparently doesn't do the firewall configuration we describe, but
it wouldn't hurt to turn it on too.
</p>
<p>
If necessary, you can implement the firewall restrictions yourself
without using any extra software.
</p>
<pre class="notranslate">iptables -A OUTPUT -d 127.0.0.1 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 25 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 25 -m owner --gid-owner mail -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 25 -m owner --gid-owner mailman -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 25 -m owner --uid-owner root -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 25 -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-port-unreachable
</pre>
<p>
You may need to add or change the "-m owner ... ACCEPT" to be
consistent with your mail server.  Eg: you'll need different
entries for Qmail.
</p>
<p>
You will also have to ensure that these iptables commands are
executed every time the system reboots, perhaps by an init script.
</p>
<p>
If you're using cPanel and APF, APF by default will wipe out iptables
rules you enter manually leaving the server vulnerable.
If you are using APF, you should make the above change via APF and
that will take care of reissuing the commands upon reboot or reset.
</p>
<p>
Note: in some virtual hosting environments, the above commands will
return error messages. This generally means that the host (not
virtually hosted) operating system does not support the iptables
kernel modules. If you do get such errors, make sure that the base
operating system has the iptables module fully installed.
</p>
<h2>r57shell Infestations</h2>
<p>
In one case, it turned out to be a file called "info.php" in the user's
images directory.
Info.php turned out to be a modified copy of the "r57shell" PHP
script which provides a backdoor through which an attacker can
do virtually anything on your web server.
</p>
<p>
Thus, even though you have changed the passwords, the spammer could
still upload the spamming scripts at will - this was found by
noticing invocations of the PHP file in the web server logs from the same IP address
the original FTP connections came from.
You will need to search for such files as well, and we recommend
preventing the execution of scripts (.php, .pl, .cgi, etc) in directories
that do not need it.
Eg: only the cgi-bin directory should permit execution.
<a href="http://www.nullamatix.com/find-r57-and-c99-shells-hidden-inside-php-and-txt-files/">Nullamatix</a> has a discussion on some simple ways to
find r57shell.
</p>
<p>
It is known that Symantec EndPoint Protection can detect the
original r57shell.
The index.php file described above was a modified r57shell, and SEP doesn't
detect it.  A handful of AV detectors detect it as Backdoor.PHP.Rst!<various versions="">,
but this doesn't help on Linux/UNIX.
Note in particular, ClamAV <strong>not</strong> detect the "info.php"
variant mentioned above.
The script in the next section should find most versions of common
trojan shells.
</various></p>

<p>
</p><h2>A Simple Trojan finding script in Perl</h2>
<p>
The following Perl script should find most trojan shells.
It was chosen to be short and simple to understand
so that an administrator would feel safe cut-and-pasting
the script and running it.
The script only looks in the most likely places, and therefore
should run very fast as a quick check.
</p>
<p>
It is not expected that this script would find every possible
trojan, so if this script fails to find anything malicious, you
will need to resort to the other methods described above.
Suggestions for improvement are welcome.
</p>
<p>
Instructions (only for webmasters with shell access to web
hosting directories):
</p>
<al>
</al></li><li>
Cut and paste the script to a file, we'll use "cblphpfind" for
the purposes of these instructions.
</li>
<li>
Make the script executable:
<pre class="notranslate">chmod 755 cblphpfind
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Run the script as a user with read access to the web hosting
directories like this:
<pre class="notranslate">./cblphpfind [list of directories]
</pre>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong>if this script finds a directory it cannot
open, it will stop.  If it does stop, you will need to run this
script as a user that has read access to the entire directory tree.
The userid that runs the web server is a good choice.
You can use "root" if you really have to.
</p><p>
On a Ubuntu system running Apache (not a hosting environment),
the following command checked the web hosting directory:
</p>
<pre class="notranslate">./cblphpfind /var/www
</pre>
<p>
If the web server uses aliases to redirect some web queries
(including virtual hosts)
to other directories, you should specify those too.
</p>
<p>
If you know which virtual host has the infection, you can try
running cblphpfind on just the directories for that virtual
host alone first.
</p>
</li>
<li>
When it finds something suspicious it will print a line like:
<p></p>
<pre class="notranslate">/var/www/malicious/.htaccess: Suspicious(RewriteRule): RewriteRule . /phpinf
</pre>
<p>
Which will name the file regarded suspicious, why it's suspicious
(above found "RewriteRule"), and a fragment of the file showing the pattern.
</p>
</li><li>
Anything that the script finds as "suspicious" should be visually
inspected and removed if it turn out to be malicious.
</li>
